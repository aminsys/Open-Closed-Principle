# Open Closed Principle
A repo to demonstrate an example of the Open/Closed principle from the SOLID principles is applied.
This project contains two files; the file "ShapeNotOpenClosed" shows code base that doesn't implement the Open/Closed principle where as the other file called "ShapeOpenClosed" illustrates the correct implementation of the Open/Closed principle.
